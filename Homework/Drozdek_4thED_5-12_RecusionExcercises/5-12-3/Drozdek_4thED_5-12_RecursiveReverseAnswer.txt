The void function 'reverse' reads in a character from the terminal. If that
character is NOT a carriage return '\n' then it calls itself and repeats the 
process until it reads a carriage return. After each function outputs the
character that it read from the terminal. Because this uses the activation
records for functions, this operates like a stack, printing in reverse order

void reverse() {
	int ch;

	ch = cin.get();

	if (ch != '\n') {
		reverse();
	}

	cout.put(ch);
}
