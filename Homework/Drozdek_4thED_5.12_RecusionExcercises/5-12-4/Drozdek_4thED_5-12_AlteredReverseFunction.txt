The altered void function 'reverse()' with 'int ch' being declared static 
changes the output by only allowing the most recent call of reverse() is 
allowed to alter ch and will be the last alteration that will be remembered. 
That is to say that the only character that will be output will be the '\n' 
carriage return n times.

void reverse() {
	static int ch;

	ch = cin.get();
	if (ch != '\n') {
		
		reverse();
	}

	cout.put(ch);
}
